# Krausen

Krausen, pronounced "KROY-zen", is a beer recipe emulator written in JavaScript.

## Features

Given a JSON object representing the recipe, Krausen can predict the following properties of the beer:

* Original gravity (OG)
* Final gravity (FG)
* Color (Â°L)
* Bitterness (IBUs)
* Alcohol by volume (ABV)
* Bitterness ratio (Balance)

Krausen supports both U.S. customary and metric units.

## Example

```javascript
var recipeJson = {
  "batch_size": "5.5 gal",

  // Percents can be numbers
  "efficiency": 75,          

  // ...or strings with units
  "evaporation_rate": "20 %",      

  "boil_time": "60 min",
  "boil_size": "6.25 gal",
  "attenuation": 75,

  // "All Grain", "Partial Mash", or "Extract"
  "recipe_type": "All Grain",      

  "fermentables": [
    {
      "amount": "9.25 lbs",

      // PPG
      "ppg": 36,                   

      // Degrees Lovibond
      "color": 1,           

      // "Grain", "Sugar", "Extract", "Dry Extract", or "Adjunct"   
      "type": "Grain"              
    }
  ],

  "hops": [
    {
      "time": "60 min",
      "amount": "1.5 oz",
      "alpha": 8.75,

      // "Boil", "Dry Hop", "Mash", "First Wort", or "Aroma"
      "hop_use": "Boil"
    }
  ]
};

var recipe = new BeerRecipe(recipeJson);

recipe.og();
recipe.fg();
recipe.color();
recipe.ibu();
recipe.abv();
recipe.balance();
```
